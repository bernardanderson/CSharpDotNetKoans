            //Under the covers .Net allocates memory for all value type objects (int, double, bool,...) on the stack. This is 
            //considerably more efficient than a heap allocation. .Net also has the ability to put a value type onto the heap.
            //(for calling methods and other reasons). The process of putting stack data into the heap is called "boxing" the 
            //process of taking the value type off the heap is called "unboxing". We won't go into the details (see Jeffrey 
            //Richter's book if you want details). This subject comes up because every time you put a value type into an 
            //ArrayList it must be boxed. Every time you read it from the ArrayList it must be unboxed. This can be a significat
            //cost.
